<h1>THE LAUGHING CELL</h1>
  <?php
  echo "<p>Patient 103 never stopped laughing. The staff said it was nerves, but no one could explain why the sound seemed to come from the walls. One evening, Nurse Eliza heard the laughter echoing outside the patients locked cell.

She opened the door to find the room empty. Her breath hitched as the laughter grew louder, closer. A shadow darted past her, brushing her arm.

By morning, her screams replaced the laughter. Eliza sat in 103s cell, laughing uncontrollably, clawing at her face..</p>";
