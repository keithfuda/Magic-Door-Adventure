<h1>SILENT WING</h1>
  <?php
  echo "<p>The asylum's 'Silent Wing' was where they kept the hopeless cases patients who never spoke, never moved. Dr. Harper was new and curious. One night, she sneaked in. The patients sat motionless in their beds, eyes wide open, staring at nothing. Except one.

At the end of the hall, a man grinned at her, teeth yellow and sharp. 'You shouldn't be here,' he whispered.

When she turned to leave, the silence was broken by the creak of beds. All the patients were standing, heads tilted toward her. She sprinted out, but the next morning, the Silent Wing was empty. No patients. Just her name scrawled on every wall.</p>";
