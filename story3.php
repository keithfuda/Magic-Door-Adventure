<h1>THE MIRROR ROOM</h1>
  <?php
  echo "<p>The asylum's basement held a room covered in mirrors, used for 'reflection therapy.' It was abandoned after patients claimed the mirrors showed them things that werent there.

Late one night, a janitor accidentally locked himself inside. He saw his reflection wave, though he hadnt moved. The mirrors showed versions of himself: older, bloodied, crying. One by one, they vanished, leaving the room pitch black.

When the staff found him the next day, he was curled in the corner, babbling about a reflection that had stepped out. His own reflection was missing.</p>";
